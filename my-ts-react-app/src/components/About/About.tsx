                    <h1>Mi Vida üåè</h1>
                    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                    <p>Well I'm so glad you asked! I was born in the Dominican Republic üèùÔ∏è,
                    and moved to the states when I was 7 years old. Since I was a child, I've loved adventures
                    and physical activity of any kind. In my day to day life I enjoy hiking, singing and songwriting, 
                    playing videogames, and spending time with my loved ones. After attending Florida A&M for 3 years,
                    I decided to begin my software engineering journey! I enrolled in an intensive, 6 month coding bootcamp
                    through Flatiron school, in which I became well aquainted with Javascript, React, Ruby on Rails, and a few
                    other languages and technologies. I am currently in the process of learning TypeScript (Check this website's code on my github üòä)!</p>
                    <h2>My Goals</h2>
                    <p>Ultimately, I strive to impact the world in as many positive ways as possible. 
                    That means regardless of the field I work in, and more importantly in spite of all 
                    the adversity life has to offer, doing everything I can to make a difference, no matter how small.
                    My ultimate passion is music, and I someday hope to be able to make a living off of my artistry. 
                    At the same time, I love the challenge the field of software engineering has to offer. 
                    I am all for learning as much as possible, and mastering my craft. On a more personal note, 
                    I hope to someday estbalish a non-profit organization that can provide dependable, trustworthy men
                    to step into the lives of children, specifically young men, who are growing up in our country without a dad.</p>
